If you want your Degus to be happy and live a long, healthy life,
then you might need to read a few tips which might help you.
One of the most inportant things is that you must have a spacious and tall cage,
which is about 52 inches in height, 32 inches in length and 21 inches in width.
Degus need a lot of space to run around in and to climb, as they are very active
during the day. 
Degus are very social animals, therefore you have to keep them in pairs or groups,
to provent them from suffering isolation, sometimes this could also leed to, not
eating enough food, not sleeping and possibly not even drinking.
Something else they would certenly like, would be to sleep peacefully, in order
to help them with that, you firtly have to set up at least 3 different, comfortable
places, which give them the freedom to choose where they would want to sleep.
Firstly, you definitely need more than 4 shelters in your cage, 2 of them have
to be filled with hay.
